          ****SQL Join is used to combine data from two or more tables, based on a common field between them.*****
IN - checks the data is fetched by the subquery ,usually prefered for small set of values
EXISTS - Checks the exist of the value and retuns true/false ,faster than IN when dealing with larger amount of data
INNER JOIN - returns the records that are common in both the tables(INTERSECTION)
CROSS JOIN - To perform every possible row combinations from both the tables(CARTESIAN PRODUCT). If WHERE clause is used then it'll act as INNER JOIN
NATURAL JOIN -  joins two tables based on the same attribute name and datatypes.
LEFT/RIGHT  JOIN - all the records from the left/right table are included and non-matching records from the left/right(opp)  table are excluded.
LEFT/RIGHT OUTER JOIN - all the records from the left/right table are included and non-matching records from the left/right(opp) table are included and the NULL value is displayed for the left/right(opp) table columns.
FULL JOIN/FULL OUTER JOIN - returns a new table containing all records of the left and right table on a match.It is a  combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN


WHERE VS HAVING - where clause cannot be used with aggregates(COUNT,SUM,AVG ETC...), but the having clause can.Where clause acts as a pre filter where as Having as a post filter.
SELECT Student, Score FROM Marks WHERE Score >=40;
SELECT Student, SUM(score) AS total FROM Marks GROUP BY Student HAVING total > 70;
SELECT name, section FROM tbl GROUP BY name, section HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;  //selects duplicates
