The brute force approach is a straightforward and exhaustive method used to solve problems. It involves systematically checking all possible solutions or combinations until the correct one is found. 
While it may not be the most efficient method,it can be useful when other optimization techniques are not applicable or when the problem space is small enough to handle.
* The brute force method is ideal for solving small and simpler problems.
* Brute force algorithms are slow.
