//STL is one of the unique abilities of C++ which makes it stand out from every other programming language. 
//STL stands for standard template library which contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers and classes which makes it very easy for
//developers or programmers to implement different data structures easily without having to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities.

//disadvantages
//It is not a standard header file of C++ library.It includes lots of unnecessary stuff and increases compilation time.It is non-portable.
